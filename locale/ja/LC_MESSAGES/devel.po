msgid ""
"One very important feature of tvtk objects is that any VTK related traits of"
" object are dynamically updated if the underlying VTK object is changed.  "
"This is achieved by adding an observer to the VTK object that effectively "
"calls TVTKBase.update_traits when the 'ModifiedEvent' is invoked.  Here is "
"an example of a VTK observer callback::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../mayavi/docs/source/tvtk/devel.txt:67
msgid ""
"As can be seen, when the property is modified, the callback is called. The "
"trouble with this approach is that `p` now holds a reference to `cb`.  Thus "
"if `cb` were the `update_traits` method of the tvtk class that manages the "
"VTK object, we run into a non-garbage-collectable reference cycle issue and "
"a huge memory leak.  To get around this we use the functionality provided by"
" `messenger.py`.  Effectively, `TVTKBase.__init__` tells messenger to call "
"`self.update_traits` when it is called back from the VTK object.  Messenger "
"itself uses `weakrefs` so the reference cycle problem does not exist.  The "
"VTK object basically calls `messenger.send` and `messenger` takes care of "
"the rest.  This allows the tvtk class to be safely used and also allows for "
"automatic trait updation."

"The first string is the name of the trait and the second the name of the "

"`messenger.py` implements a simple, robust, safe, `Messenger` class that "

"is Borg.  So it is easy to instantiate and use.  This module is also reload-"
"safe, so if the module is reloaded the callback information is not lost.  "

"attribute is not pickled since VTK objects are not picklable.  Other "
"irrelevant attributes are also removed. `__setstate__` works even on a live "
"object by checking to see if `self._vtk_obj` exists.  Some of the tvtk "

"TVTK lets the user pass Numeric arrays/Python lists in place of the "
"`DataArray`, `CellArray`, `Points` etc. classes.  This is done by finding "
"the call signature of the wrapped VTK method, checking to see if it has an "
"array and then intelligently generating the appropriate VTK array data using"
" the signature information.  This generated VTK data array is then passed to"
" the wrapped function under the covers. This functionality also works if the"
" method has multiple call signatures (overloaded VTK method) and one of them"
" involves arrays. The main functions to do this conversion magic are in the "
"`array_handler.py` module.  The `wrapper_gen.py` module generates the "
"appropriate wrapper code depending on the call signature.  So if a method "
"has no VTK objects in its signature, no wrapping is necessary. If it only "
"has non-array VTK objects, then array handling is unnecessary but one must "
"dereference the VTK object from the passed tvtk wrapper object.  If the call"
" signature involves VTK array objects, then any Numeric arrays or Python "
"lists are converted to the correct VTK data array and passed to the wrapped "
"VTK object."

"The imported `tvtk` is really an instance of a class and not a module! This "
